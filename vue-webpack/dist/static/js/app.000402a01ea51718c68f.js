As the seasons, rainy and dry, pass by, it expands like an accordian filled with air, and then contracts again, the troughs running deeper, the peaks more prominent.  As with all plants, a cactus must take in carbon dioxide to survive, as we take in breath, and so opens it tiny pores, called stomata, in a process called transpiration.  Most flora open their apertures beneath the sun's rays, but cactus wait until the darkness of night, so the sun wonâ€™t rob them of their drops.  A cactus's spines are highly modified leaves, thin to prevent water loss in transpiration, and tapered to a point to guard from thirsty preditors who would try to seize the water within."),n("br"),n("br"),e._v("\n\n      Cacti are quite diversified, each one uniquely adapted to survive the desert dryness.  The Sacasil, the Desert Prickly Pear, the Pasakana and Patilon, the Kepo and Koko, Aboringine's Comb, the Arizona Hedgehog, the Rhinoceros Cactus, the Old Man of Mexico, the Quepo, the Odieri, the Owl's Eye, the Lady Finger Cactus, the Sacamatraca and the Sandillon, the Queen of the Night.  Each distictive, each designed to survive.  The diversiform collection seem almost alien, the prickly barrels hunching near the ground, the taller stems reaching into the arid sky, some stretching out like antennae from another world.  Some almost colorless, blending in with the barren landscape, some dotted with delicate sprouts of color.  Each an auquifer within, each expanding and contracting, plusing with the seasons."),n("br"),n("br"),e._v("\n\n      Water is life.  The earth a living, breathing sphere, seventy-one percent water.  The soggy clouds drifting above us.  The glaciers frozen on mountain tops and ice caps hardened at the top and bottom of our world. The unseen reservoirs flowing beneath the surface.  Our home, though firm beneath our feet, its hardened ground stretching out to the horizon, is mostly water, ebbing and flowing even down to its molten core, churning and giving life."),n("br"),n("br"),e._v("\n\n      The human body is seventy-five percent water at its birth.  But as we age, the water slowly ebbs away.  Aged and arid, we leave this life only half water, the remainder drained away.  We would only survive about a week without water.  One man survived for twenty-four days, unconscious, his pulse slowed, almost silent.  We, too, depend on waterâ€™s life-giving force.  It carries nutrients and vitamins throughout the body, and electrical messages between cells.  It protects the spinal cord, and helps absorb the daily shocks and pressures on our joints.  It aids in digesting food, and clearing out waste and toxins, cleasing the body from within.  Sometimes the water within us finds its way out, whether as sweat to cool us, urine to cleanse us, or as tears to reveal something deeper inside us."),n("br"),n("br"),e._v("\n\n      Some cactus roots catch the dew that drips off its stem in the morning light.  They catch their own tears.  Without, their spines seems to threaten, push away, but within they have water and life.

Perhaps, like the cactus, we too build prickly spines, keeping others out to protect what lies within."),n("br"),n("br"),e._v("\n\n      Cactus are buit to survive, adapted to save what's scarce.  But sometimes this can backfire, flooding it out, rotting it from within and making it more vulnerable to disease when water is too abundant.  Our protections can also bring harsh consequences.  The walls we build around ourselves, our protective spines, guard our fragile hearts during threatening times.  But they also keep others out, as we hide, alone within ourselves.  Perhaps we can learn to pluck out these spines, and open ourselves so that our water, our life, can give life to all, and them to us, because there is more than enough to spare."),n("br"),n("br")])])}]};var w=n("VU/8")({name:"Writings",data:function(){return{name:"Writings"}}},f,!1,function(e){n("aax2"),n("qPqb")},"data-v-891b04b6",null).exports,y={render:function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return t("div",{staticClass:"page"},[t("h1",[this._v(this._s(this.name))]),this._v(" "),t("h2",[this._v("I would love to hear from you!")]),this._v(" "),this._m(0)])},staticRenderFns:[function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return t("div",{staticClass:"info"},[t("form",{staticClass:"contactform",attrs:{method:"POST",action:"https://formspree.io/sarah.hilton.1997@gmail.com"}},[t("input",{attrs:{type:"email",name:"email",placeholder:"Your Email"}}),t("br"),this._v(" "),t("textarea",{attrs:{name:"message",placeholder:"Your Message"}}),t("br"),this._v(" "),t("button",{attrs:{type:"submit"}},[this._v("Send")])])])}]};var k=n("VU/8")({name:"Contact",data:function(){return{name:"Contact"}}},y,!1,function(e){n("fgNs"),n("jZ7X")},"data-v-c106a042",null).exports,A={render:function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,n=e._self._c||t;return n("div",{staticClass:"todo"},[n("h1",[e._v("A List of Things To Do")]),e._v(" "),n("p",{directives:[{name:"show",rawName:"v-show",value:0===e.activeTodos.length,expression:"activeTodos.length === 0"}]},[e._v("You are done with all your tasks!
